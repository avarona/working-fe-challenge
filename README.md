## Overview

This simple eCommerce site is almost complete! There are a few UX issues and bugs that you need to address to get us to the finish line. Questions are encouraged, [Ask us](mailto:jason@cubesoftware.com?cc=alejandro@cubesoftware.com;alex.lee@cubesoftware.com;ash@cubesoftware.com&subject=Questions%20about%20code%20challenge) about requirements, expectations, and unclear goals. Someone should get back to you soon, any time, any day. Don't worry about bothering us; just focus on completing the job to the best of your ability and making your client happy.

The assignment should only take a few of hours, but take as long as you need. We expect you to do this on your own and treat it like a real client project with the same level of care, quality code and good commits. After completing the assignment, please also commit your answers to the questions [below](#follow-up-questions).
